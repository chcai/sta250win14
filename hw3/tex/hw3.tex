I started out exploring linear/quadratic discriminant analysis. However, these methods are not feasible for this assignment, as an assumption is the normality of the independent variables. Usually, the normality assumption can be slightly violated, and we would still get reasonable results. However, normality would be grossly violated here. For one thing, we have some discrete variables; it would be a shame to ignore them. As for the numerical (continuous) variables, most of them are not even close to normal even after transformations. Therefore, I directed my attention to logistic regression.
