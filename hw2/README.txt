I chose to use read.csv() on gauss. Each job reads one file and writes a frequency table to a txt file. It took

3 mins 31 secs

to make all the frequency tables. And another few seconds to get the desired statistics.

gauss.R reads a csv file and makes a frequency table.

gauss.sh is the shell script needed to execute gauss.R on gauss.

gaussPro.R computes the desired statistics.

report.doc is a work in progress report.
